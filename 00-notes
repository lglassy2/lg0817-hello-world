Python Zip Applications
-----------------------

This repo ('python_zip') is an example of using a zip file
as an executable python application.  The result is 'executable'
in the sense of being 'interpretable' - you need to have a python
interpreter installed.

The resulting zip file can contain multiple python packages.
Each package will have a directory with an __init__.py 
file to mark the directory as a python package.

Subpackages follow the same logic, having their subdirectories
with __init__.py files in them.

Inside a package directory, you can have multiple python modules.
The module name is the same as the file prefix name of a python 
file in a package directory.   So 'red.py' and 'green.py' are 
the module files for modules 'red' and 'green', etc.

How to assemble a Python Zip Application
----------------------------------------

$ zip -r bar.zip __main__.py locpkg 

You can use any level of compression desired.  Given that the 
contents of the zip app are tiny, it really doesn't matter.  I 
generally use either no compression (-r0) or the default level 
of compression (-r).

How to run the zip application 
------------------------------

$ python3 bar.zip <zip app command line args go here>
